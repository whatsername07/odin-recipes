        <p title="Description">
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish, and one of the oldest forms of pasta, consisting of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with various ingredients and baked in the oven. The most common preparation, often called <b>Lasagna al Forno</b> (baked lasagna), involves alternating layers of lasagna pasta, a rich ragù (a meat-based sauce, typically beef or a combination of meats), and a creamy béchamel sauce or ricotta cheese, all generously topped with cheese.  The result is a hearty, deeply flavored casserole with distinct layers of soft pasta, savory meat sauce, and melted, bubbly cheese, making it a beloved comfort food worldwide.
