        <p title="Description">
            Chicken katsu curry is a popular Japanese dish that features a crispy, deep-fried chicken cutlet, known as "katsu," served alongside a thick, savory-sweet Japanese curry sauce and often steamed rice. The chicken is typically coated in panko breadcrumbs, which are large and flaky, giving it a uniquely crunchy texture. The curry sauce is distinct from South Asian curries, being generally mild, rich, and slightly sweet with aromatic, sometimes fruity notes, achieved through ingredients like grated apple or honey, along with a blend of spices. The contrast between the crunchy coating of the chicken and the smooth, velvety sauce is what makes this dish a satisfying and much-loved favorite.
